My research interests lie broadly in gravity and field theory, with a strong emphasis on formal theory. 
Particular topics I have worked on include the effective field theory (EFT) of gravity, extremal black holes and black branes, aelectric-magnetic duality, and two-dimensional theories.  

What follows is a summary of my work, in roughly chronological order (so scroll down for my most recent work!).

### Infrared Causality

As a field theory, GR is a non-renormalisable theory.
It indicates that one should make sense of this within the EFT framework, with the Einstein-Hilbert action being the leading contribution to the full effective action.
This is accompanied by a tower of higher-derivative corrections, which capture the effects of generic UV completions of gravity without appealing to a particular quantum theory of gravity. 
From a phenomenological perspective, this is a powerful tool to parameterise “quantum gravity” effects at low energies. 
A natural question is what the space of possible EFTs is.

(Relativistic) causality as a fundamental concept has a long history of putting constraints on the S-matrix. 
For non-gravitational theories, Wilson coefficients are constrained by positivity bounds, derived from imposing Lorentz invariance, unitarity, locality, and causality in the UV. 
Crucially, it has been noted that these are linked to causality (in the sense of subluminal propagation speeds) within the low-energy theory itself. 
Extending this to theories with dynamical gravity is subtle, because naïve causality is not invariant under field redefinitions involving the metric. 

In work with my collaborators Claudia de Rham, Aoibheann Margalit, and Andrew J. Tolley, I propose infrared (IR) causality as the physical notion of causality to constrain EFTs.
This is an improvement on for instance the notion of asymptotic causality, as it agrees with expectations from known partial UV completions such as QED on curved spacetime and positivity/S-matrix bootstrap bounds. 
Emphasis is put on the fact that it is crucial to be within the regime of validity of both the approximations used to diagnose causality.

As a [proof of concept](https://inspirehep.net/literature/1986852), we applied this to the Gauss-Bonnet operator as the prototypical EFT correction to gravity in $D \geq 5$. 
We show that for graviton scattering in spherical symmetry, this is consistent with IR causality as long as its Wilson coefficient is order unity. 
Within the semiclassical approximation, it looks like stronger bounds on the Wilson coefficients can be inferred by scattering off a larger number of sources.
In [follow-up work](https://inspirehep.net/literature/2696154), we consider this possibility by studying scattering on general pp-wave backgrounds, which includes successive shockwaves. 
We clarify that within the eikonal, semiclassical, and Born approximations the aforementioned tighter bounds are not possible within the regimes of validity of the respective approximations and the EFT itself.

### Extremal black holes and branes

Black holes are ubiquitous objects in our universe, that (in four dimensions) can be characterised by their mass, charge, and angular momentum. 
Physical black holes satisfy certain inequalities that put upper limits on their charge and angular momentum, and black holes saturating these are known as extremal black holes.
Recently, it has been argued that certain static deformations lead to (scalar polynomial) singularities at their horizons. 

Intriguingly, certain linearised modes in GR sit precisely on the cusp of being singular, so that arbitrarily small EFT corrections can make them singular. 
This is however in stark contrast with usual intuition we have about EFTs, namely the principles of decoupling and separation of scales. 
In my [work](https://inspirehep.net/literature/2817310) in collaboration with Andrew J. Tolley and Claudia de Rham, I take a closer look at these deformations to resolve this underlying tension. 
We clarify that the apparent UV sensitivity is not due to a breakdown of EFT, but rather indicates metric perturbation theory breaking down.
This is demonstrated by an example of a partial UV completion.
We also discuss a speculative bound on EFT Wilson coefficients linked to the weak gravity conjecture.

Precisely how the deformations behave near the horizon is determined by the $\text{AdS}_2$ scaling dimension of the perturbations within the near-horizon geometry of the extremal black holes.
It turns out this quantity is also relevant for the severity of a classical instability of extremal black holes known as the Aretakis instability.
In particular, it determines the number of transverse derivatives needed to see non-decay/blow-up of perturbations on the background geometry. 
In [follow-up work](https://inspirehep.net/literature/2948339) with A. D. Kovacs, I argue that extremal black branes (extended versions of black holes in higher dimensions with non-compact horizons) also suffer from the Aretakis instability, making explicit use of the symmetries of the near-horizon geometry $\text{AdS}_{p+2} \times S^{D-p-2}$. 
To demonstrate that this class of extremal black branes suffers from this instability even in the absence of additional fields, we compute the Kaluza-Klein spectrum of gravitational and form field perturbations of the near-horizon geometry of these black branes.
We find that these indeed trigger the Aretakis instability, although this is weaker than for the extremal black branes.

Sub-extremal black branes are subject to the so-called Gregory-Laflamme instability, which is triggered by short-wavelength perturbations. 
This instability switches off in the extremal limit, but our work shows that the Aretakis instability takes over in this limit. 
For black holes, it was shown that the Aretakis instability generically pushes extremal black holes to become sub-extremal. 
It would be interesting if this is the case also for extremal black branes, as these would then be subject to the Gregory-Laflamme instability.
In this case, one would expect that the end-point of this evolution is an array of sub-extremal black holes.

Parallel to the previous discussion on deformations of extremal black holes, the Aretakis instability also allows for set-ups which are seemingly UV sensitive.
It is also worth noting that the scaling dimensions also determine the behaviour of certain static deformations to the near-horizon geometry of extremal black branes.

### (Twisted) self-duality and (higher-spin) gauge fields

Maxwell theory in vacuum has a curious symmetry known as electromagnetic duality.
Exchanging the electric and magnetic field exchanges the equation of motion and the Bianchi identity&mdash;this can be shown to be an off-shell symmetry, associated with a non-zero conserved charge.
This is, in fact, also feature of a whole range of other theories, such as linearised gravity, higher-spin gauge fields, and p-form electrodynamics. 
In all these cases, the (classical) equations of motion can be cast into so-called twisted self-duality relations, which resemble (anti-)self-duality relations that chiral fields satisfy. 
These theories have in common that constructing actions with (twisted) self-duality as equations of motion typically come at the expense of manifest covariance.
Only relatively recently has it been realised that a natural covariant description of such theories comes from topological field theory in one higher dimension.

In this context, a particularly interesting family of theories to study are the singletons. 
These are topological field theories sitting special representations of the $\text{AdS}_{2p+1}$ isometries, which reduce to chiral/dual theories in $D=2p$ (with odd/even $p$) dimensions. 
As a [proof of principle](https://inspirehep.net/literature/2873371), in work with Karapet Mkrtchyan, Euihun Joung, and Junggi Yoon, we study the minimal case of $p=1$ for arbitrary spin.
This reduces higher-spin gravity in $\text{AdS}_3$ to higher-order chiral (or shift-symmetric) scalars in $D=2$.
We use the covariant boundary reduction procedure to find covariant higher-spin generalisations to the Floreanini-Jackiw and Alekseev-Shatashvili actions.

In upcoming work with Karapet Mkrtchyan and Euihun Joung, we generalise this to spin-2 theories in $D=2p$ dimensions. 
Of particular interest for this is the case $p=2$, which describes familiar linearised gravity in $D=4$.
This provides a formulation of linearised gravity which exhibits manifest duality and covariance, which was previously thought not to be possible.

### Discrete series scalar fields in $\text{(A)dS}_{2}$

It is well-known that conformal transformations and closely related to holomorphicity in two dimensions. 
In particular, holomorphic operators such as the stress tensor in a CFT can be used to show holomorphic splitting of the classical phase space of solutions. 
The prototypical example of this is the massless scalar field $\phi$ in two-dimensional flat space.
This possess a pair of (anti-)holomorphic currents $j = \partial \phi$ and $\overline{j} = \overline{\partial}\phi$, which generate shifts of the scalar field by constants.
In Lorentzian signature, the decomposition of the phase space is related to the familiar statement that the field in question is made up of non-interacting left- and right-moving waves propagating on the light cone.
One might hence expect that, as soon as the theory is deformed by a mass term, the nice properties of the massless theory described above disappear. 

In upcoming work with Lukas W. Lindwasser, I discuss the two-dimensional singletons studied above as a counter-example to this.
In particular, these are massive scalar fields in $\text{(A)dS}_{2}$ with integer scaling dimensions $\Delta = k+1$, which are marked by the existence of a pair of (anti-)holomorphic higher-spin currents which generate extended shift symmetries. 
We explore the consequences of this to describe their quantisation and subsets of their linear and non-linear symmetries.
In particular, we point out that the theories admit mode expansions reminiscent of standard $2d$ CFTs in complex coordinates, with which we are able to construct operators implementing global conformal transformations and Virasoro symmetry. 
We further leverage holomorphicity of the currents to show that the full set of symmetries of theories with $k>0$ is captured by a chiral algebra contained in the one of the massless theory. 
This allows us to identify integrable deformations for $`k \leq 2`$. 
We finally point out that a lack of integrable deformations for $`k>2`$ is a consequence of a known conjecture.
